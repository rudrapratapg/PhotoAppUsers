Here is a detailed description of your User Microservice application:

**Overview**

The User Microservice is a self-contained application designed to manage the entire lifecycle of users within a larger system. This microservice is built using a microservices architecture and utilizes the Eureka Server for service discovery and registration. By leveraging the Eureka Client dependency, the User Microservice can seamlessly integrate with other services within the system, enabling efficient communication and load balancing.

**Key Features**

The User Microservice provides the following key features:

1. **User Registration**: The microservice allows new users to register, creating a new user account with relevant details.
2. **User Login**: Existing users can log in to the system, authenticating their credentials to access protected resources.
3. **User Details Retrieval**: The microservice provides an API to retrieve user details, enabling other services to access user information as needed.
4. **User Details Update**: Users can update their details, such as profile information or account settings, through the microservice's API.
5. **User Account Deletion**: Users can delete their accounts, removing their details from the system.

**Service Discovery and Registration**

To facilitate communication between services, the User Microservice utilizes the Eureka Server for service discovery and registration. When the User Microservice starts up, it registers itself with the Eureka Discovery Service, making its presence known to other services within the system. This registration process enables other services to discover and communicate with the User Microservice indirectly, through the Eureka dashboard.

**Benefits**

The User Microservice offers several benefits, including:

* **Decoupling**: By using a microservices architecture, the User Microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services, reducing the complexity of the overall system.
* **Load Balancing**: The Eureka Server enables load balancing, ensuring that incoming requests are distributed efficiently across multiple instances of the User Microservice, improving responsiveness and reliability.
* **Fault Tolerance**: With multiple instances of the User Microservice registered with the Eureka Server, the system can continue to function even if one instance becomes unavailable, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime.

**Technical Details**

The User Microservice is built using a microservices architecture, with the following technical details:

* **Programming Language**: Java
* **Framework**: Spring Boot
* **Dependencies**: Eureka Client dependency for service discovery and registration
* **API Endpoints**: [Insert API endpoints for user registration, login, details retrieval, update, and deletion]

By providing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and load-balanced User Microservice, your application can efficiently manage user lifecycle events, ensuring a seamless experience for users and a robust foundation for your larger system.
